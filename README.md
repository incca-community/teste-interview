# teste-interview

You will make an application, using the github api, where you must make a login screen and after logging in with the github user, make a search field to search the repositories of each one.
When you're done, upload the repository where your application was saved and provide how to run it to email (qualidade@incca.com.br)
Good luck
That's it! Thank you for taking this test!
